SwevsChunkCollector is a high-performance plugin designed to automate item collection and reduce server lag. It allows players to place "Chunk Collectors" that instantly gather drops within a chunk, keeping your world clean and your farms efficient.

Key Features:

Automated Collection: Instantly picks up items within a chunk, preventing entity lag from massive farms.

Economy Integration: Automatically sells collected items for profit, with support for ShopGUI+, EconomyShopGUI, and Vault.
Balanced Gameplay: Collectors operate on a "battery" system, requiring players to spend money to recharge them via a sleek GUI—adding a balanced money sink to your economy.

Live Holograms: Displays real-time statistics like money earned and remaining charge directly above the collector (supports FancyHolograms, DecentHolograms, & HolographicDisplays).

Optimized & Scalable: Built with performance in mind, using asynchronous tasks and supporting MySQL/Redis for cross-server data syncing.
